# Transparent inbound benchmark

This benchmark compares transparent interception paths with one traffic
generator, one isolated topology, and one direct endpoint. It is intended for
regression testing and engineering measurements. It is not a universal ranking:
kernel version, CPU frequency, offloads, routing rules, and background traffic
can change the result.

See [LOCAL.md](LOCAL.md) for standard Linux and rooted Android procedures. The
rooted Android TCP and UDP matrix uses
[`android-inbound-benchmark.sh`](android-inbound-benchmark.sh) to reproduce the
same three-namespace topology entirely on the device.

## Compared paths

| Variant | Interception setup | Protocols |
|---|---|---|
| `direct` | No sing-box process or interception | TCP and UDP |
| `ebpf-local` | Application cgroup hooks | TCP and UDP |
| `ebpf-shared` | TC ingress/egress on the downstream router interface | TCP and UDP |
| `redirect` | Redirect listener and a destination-scoped NAT rule | TCP only |
| `tproxy` | TProxy listener, mark, policy route, and destination-scoped rules | TCP and UDP |
| `tun-go` | sing-box 1.15 native Go stack, `auto_route: true`, `auto_redirect: false` | TCP and UDP |
| `tun-go-auto-redirect` | sing-box 1.15 native Go stack, `auto_route: true`, `auto_redirect: true` | TCP and UDP |
| `tun-mixed` | legacy `stack: mixed`, `auto_route: true`, `auto_redirect: false` | TCP and UDP |
| `tun-mixed-auto-redirect` | legacy `stack: mixed`, `auto_route: true`, `auto_redirect: true` | TCP and UDP |

The two TUN variants deliberately differ only in `auto_redirect`. The benchmark
does not expose separate system or gVisor stack variants. Redirect UDP results
are omitted instead of substituting a different implementation.

## Workloads

| Scenario | Reported rate | Main pressure |
|---|---|---|
| `tcp-short` | Completed request/response connections per second | Setup, interception, dispatch, and cleanup |
| `tcp-upload` | Server-confirmed bit/s | Persistent client-to-server throughput |
| `tcp-download` | Client-received bit/s | Persistent server-to-client throughput |
| `udp-pps` | Echoed datagrams/s from connected sockets | Connected UDP state and round trips |
| `udp-unconnected-pps` | Echoed datagrams/s from unconnected sockets | Per-destination sendmsg and flow lookup |
| `udp-churn` | One echoed datagram per newly created socket | Cookie publication, cleanup, recovery, and map pressure |

TCP upload and UDP datagram sizes are independent. The defaults are 32 KiB and
1200 bytes respectively. Long uploads use framed data and server confirmation,
so bytes accepted only by a local socket buffer are not counted. UDP rates are
confirmed request/echo round trips, not unchecked send rates.

## Automated topology

The runner creates application, router, and server network namespaces connected
by veth pairs. The application client always runs as UID 65534 and sing-box runs
as root. Every transparent rule is limited to the benchmark server address and
port. The same topology supports IPv4 and IPv6; each run uses one family and
records it in `environment/run.txt`.

Each repetition randomizes variant order. Normal measurements use a release
binary. Correctness checks run separately:

- local eBPF rejects direct OUTPUT from the client UID after the cgroup hook;
- shared eBPF, Redirect, and TProxy reject direct router forwarding after their
  expected interception point;
- both TUN variants must increment the dedicated TUN interface counters.

A failed check marks the job failed and is never included in the median. This is
important because a misconfigured transparent path can otherwise look like a
very fast direct connection.

## Run the workflow

Start the `Inbound benchmark` workflow manually. Its main inputs are:

- `family`: `ipv4` or `ipv6`;
- `variants`: a comma-separated subset of the table above;
- `scenarios`: `all` or a comma-separated workload list;
- `duration`, `warmup`, `repetitions`, and `concurrency`;
- `tcp_payload_size` and `udp_payload_size`;
- `ebpf_policy_prefixes`: non-matching CIDRs used to stress eBPF bypass lookup;
- `profile_seconds`: dedicated eBPF diagnostic duration, or zero to disable it.

The job uploads raw reports, sing-box logs and configurations, topology and
offload records, process snapshots, validation reports, and a median summary.
Do not combine results from different address families, payload sizes, kernels,
or policy-prefix counts.

GitHub-hosted runners are useful for functional coverage and large same-job
regressions. Use a fixed bare-metal runner carrying the `inbound-benchmark`
label for publishable performance comparisons. Run at least five repetitions
and repeat the whole experiment on different days.

## eBPF policy pressure

Set `ebpf_policy_prefixes` to create up to 32,768 non-adjacent host prefixes in
an inline `bypass_rule_set`. The prefixes never contain the benchmark server,
so traffic still traverses the interception path while every eBPF decision
performs a policy miss lookup. A value of zero measures the no-rule-set path.

Run zero and a representative large value as separate experiments. The option
applies only to eBPF inbounds; direct, Redirect, TProxy, and TUN remain reference
paths. The generated policy source is included in the artifact.

## eBPF diagnostics

When `profile_seconds` is non-zero, the workflow builds a second sing-box binary
with `ebpf_debug`. After all release-binary measurements it runs local and shared
connected UDP diagnostics separately for every selected eBPF mode. These runs:

- use `experimental.debug.listen` for CPU, allocation, and heap profiles;
- log startup and shutdown eBPF snapshots with map occupancy, map and program
  IDs, and memlock usage;
- enable kernel `BPF_STATS_RUN_TIME` when supported, exposing run count, total
  runtime, average ns/run, and recursion misses for each BPF program.

The debug build does not run a periodic reporter or add UDP hot-path and
maintenance counters.

Debug runs are stored under `profiles/local` and `profiles/shared`; they are not
loaded by the summary tool and must not be compared with release throughput.
The kernel stats switch is system-wide while the diagnostic inbound is active,
which is another reason to keep this phase separate.

## Interpreting results

The summary reports each median and its percentage of the direct median for the
same scenario. Always inspect raw reports and reject runs with errors, packet
loss, thermal throttling, link renegotiation, or unexpected background traffic.
Also compare process CPU ticks, RSS/VmHWM, and the eBPF program runtime statistics;
throughput alone cannot distinguish user-space cost from BPF data-plane cost.

For controlled A/B work, keep constant:

- sing-box commit, build tags, configuration, and log level;
- kernel, device firmware, CPU governor, affinity, and thermal state;
- NIC, MTU, link speed, and offloads;
- server, route, payload, concurrency, duration, and warmup;
- address family and eBPF policy-prefix count.

Network switching, interface flap, suspend/resume, and long-running map lifecycle
tests are stability tests, not throughput workloads. Run and report them
separately so transient recovery behavior does not distort steady-state medians.
