// upload pipe, which means the pooled connection is up, the stream is open and
// writes will be drained. The download response is NOT awaited: an Xray server
// withholds it until the first uplink bytes (SPEC 061), so waiting for it here
// would deadlock the dial. Until the raise the dial context bounds everything
// (the pooled connection's TCP/TLS dial, the stream slot, the header write);
// after DialContext returns the dial context has no effect on the conn — the
// net.Dialer contract every other transport keeps. Field case: the DNS
// transport pool (dns/transport/conn_pool.go, upstream) cancels its dial
// context the moment dial returns, and the former SPEC 050 guard — armed on
// that context until the download response, which stream-one only sends after
// the first write — tore every such conn down with "context canceled" before
// the first query left the pipe.
//
// adoptedBody is the request body handed to the HTTP layer: the first Read CALL
// closes `adopted`. The call, not its return — x/net http2 issues that Read
// right after the request headers and it blocks on the pipe until the caller's
// first Write, so waiting for it to return would revive the 061 deadlock in a
