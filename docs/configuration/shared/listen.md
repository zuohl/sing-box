### Fields

#### listen

==Required==

Listen address.

#### listen_port

Listen port.

#### bind_interface

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.12.0"

The network interface to bind to.

#### routing_mark

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.12.0"

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux.

Set netfilter routing mark.

Integers (e.g. `1234`) and string hexadecimals (e.g. `"0x1234"`) are supported.

#### reuse_addr

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.12.0"

Reuse listener address.

#### netns

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.12.0"

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux.

Set network namespace, name or path.

Since sing-box 1.14.0, the tag of a [network namespace](/configuration/network-namespace/) can also be used.

#### tcp_fast_open

Enable TCP Fast Open.

#### tcp_multi_path

!!! warning ""

    Go 1.21 required.

Enable TCP Multi Path.

#### disable_tcp_keep_alive

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.13.0"

Disable TCP keep alive.

#### tcp_keep_alive

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.13.0"

    Default value changed from `10m` to `5m`.

TCP keep alive initial period.

`5m` will be used by default.

#### tcp_keep_alive_interval

TCP keep alive interval.

`75s` will be used by default.

#### tcp_keep_alive_count

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.13.0"

TCP keep-alive probe count.

Uses system default if not set or set to `0`.

#### udp_gso

Allow Generic Segmentation Offload for UDP replies to clients on this inbound, including quic-go based QUIC transports.

Omitting this field or setting it to `true` retains automatic detection. Setting it to `false` disables send segmentation while preserving ordinary UDP batch sends and receives.
This does not control receive-side GRO or the TUN `gso` option. Protocols using other networking engines are not controlled by this option.

`SING_BOX_DISABLE_GSO=true`, read at process startup, disables GSO globally for sing UDP and quic-go.
`QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=true` continues to disable GSO only in quic-go. `udp_gso: true` cannot override these prohibitions or platform limitations.

#### udp_fragment

Enable UDP fragmentation.

#### udp_timeout

UDP NAT expiration time.

`5m` will be used by default.

#### detour

If set, connections will be forwarded to the specified inbound.

Requires target inbound support, see [Injectable](/configuration/inbound/#fields).

#### sniff

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.11.0"

    Inbound fields are deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.13.0, check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-legacy-inbound-fields-to-rule-actions).

Enable sniffing.

See [Protocol Sniff](/configuration/route/sniff/) for details.

#### sniff_override_destination

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.11.0"

    Inbound fields are deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.13.0.

Override the connection destination address with the sniffed domain.

If the domain name is invalid (like tor), this will not work.

#### sniff_timeout

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.11.0"

    Inbound fields are deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.13.0, check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-legacy-inbound-fields-to-rule-actions).

Timeout for sniffing.

`300ms` is used by default.

#### domain_strategy

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.11.0"

    Inbound fields are deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.13.0, check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-legacy-inbound-fields-to-rule-actions).

One of `prefer_ipv4` `prefer_ipv6` `ipv4_only` `ipv6_only`.

If set, the requested domain name will be resolved to IP before routing.

If `sniff_override_destination` is in effect, its value will be taken as a fallback.

#### udp_disable_domain_unmapping

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.11.0"

    Inbound fields are deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.13.0, check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-legacy-inbound-fields-to-rule-actions).

If enabled, for UDP proxy requests addressed to a domain, 
the original packet address will be sent in the response instead of the mapped domain.

This option is used for compatibility with clients that 
do not support receiving UDP packets with domain addresses, such as Surge.

#### proxy_protocol

Parse [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) in the connection header.

#### proxy_protocol_accept_no_header

Accept connections without Proxy Protocol header.
